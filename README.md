Simple Vehicle Controller
----------------------------------
Unity project about a simple car controller using the different tools provided by Unity.

The main component used was collision rim colliders, which by means of physics move the car. Everything was done by programming and configuring the inputs with Unity's new Input System. The car can accelerate, turn and brake, besides having an automatic camera that follows and rotates with the car.

In the project you will also find a complete model made in Blender of a vehicle that was used to make this demo. Also in the scene you will find different obstacles to interact the car with them.

To be able to steer the car, the movement is with the keys W, A, S, D, to brake the car is with the space bar and to be able to reset the position of the car is with the R key.

In the project you will find useful things to understand how to start making a racing game or focused on the use of vehicles in Unity.
